notes: directory listing for external hard drive management 2022-06-19

I want to make a diredtory tree for cataloging my old external hard drives as I move them to a NAS
Ideally they will end up looking something like this:

D:\
├── VIDEOS (15 files, 7 directories)
│	├── Bvideos (15 files, 1 directory)
│	│   └── BVIDEOS (15 files)
│	├── Fake (23 files)
│	├── Help (15 files)
│	├── Misc (15 files)
│	├── New (15 files)
│	├── small (15 files, 1 directory)
│	│   └── New folder (15 files)
│	└── inf (15 files)

etc...

there is code on stack overflow to generate something similar 
	here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/59109706

however it does not create exactly what I need 
	-no ennumeration of the dirs and files in a specific directory
	-breakes on $RECYCLE.BIN hidden folder in hard drive

I'm going to work on a new/modified version

creating a conda env in windows:
	conda create --name dirlist39 python=3.9

creating a new project folder:
	"\Prohect - dir_list"

script file in project dir:
	dir_list.py

and jupyter notebook for testing:
	dir_list_exploration.ipynb


start with re-learning about generators:
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD05uGo_sVI


after learning about generators I had to mess with the layout of the code to deal with the recursion that was happening
as the enumeration of the contents of the needed to happen before the next instance of recursion

so I had to dive into the directories count the contents then come back up with that number in order to print it
at the appropriate time

it works!

in order to deal with issues regarding file permissions ($RECYCLE.BIN and System Volume Information) I added those as
criteria when evaluating the next set fo contents to add to the directory tree

done!
